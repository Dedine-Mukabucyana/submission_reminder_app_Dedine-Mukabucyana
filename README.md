TASK 1: Creating the setup script
My setup allows the user to create a directory with the name he/she wishes to be called, creates reminder of those who didin't do the assignments

The first task creates  main directory which is called submission_reminder_app_Dedine-Mukabucyana
 .I created the directory called submission_reminder_Dedine that contains script to aloww the user to enter their names which later creates other directories
 .The subdirectories are created inside submission_reminder_Dedine which contains (app,modules,assets,config,startu.sh)
